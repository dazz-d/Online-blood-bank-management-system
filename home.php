Importance of Blood Donation</h3>
<h4>
Blood donation is one of the most significant contribution that a person can make towards the society. It is not harmful for an adult person to donate blood. The body of the donor can regenerate the blood within few days. It poses no threat to the metabolism of the body.

The World Blood Donor Day is observed on 14th June every year.

 
An ailing body needs blood for various reasons. He may be attacked with anemia, undergone an operation or may meet with an accident. But such a patient may die for want of blood as it is not always available. Even a pregnant mother may need blood in case of emergency situation.

The patient needs blood or his or her group of blood whenever necessary. It is another important thing. Blood has four groups namely, A. B, AB and O. The required group must be the same while transplanting otherwise the transplantation will go in vain and even the patient may die. The man with the O-group blood is called the universal donor as the people having others can accept it. On the contrary, the man with AB group of blood is called the universal receiver as he can accept all groups of blood.
